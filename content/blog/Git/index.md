## What is Git?

Put simply, Git is a software tool that allows developers to keep track of different "versions" of software.

## Why is it an important tool in web development?

Version control is important in software/web development because in the course of building a piece of software many changes can be
made over given period of time.  Some of those changes might result in bugs, others might break another piece of the codebase, or not
be completly compatable.  It also lets developers test out new features by "branching" off and trying out something before merging it with the main codebase.  If there is an error a bug, version control software like Git allows you to "roll back" changes to an earlier version.  Git also allows for better development in teams - multiple people can be working on the same files at the same time, and are able to merge the files back together when they are finished. 

## What is Github?  What is the difference between Git and Github?

Github is a platform, owned by Microsoft, that hosts Git repositories online. It provides its own set of tools to compliment a regular Git workflow, including a command line interface, forks/pull requests, and team/individual, public/private repositories.  Github also has detailed documentation for using Git along with its services.  

The Github command line interface allows a user to interact directly with Github repositories, letting you create new repositories, look at histories, add notes, and more.  Pull requests allow the owner of a repository to review modifications to a forked version of that repository and determine whether or not to allow a merge of the modifications to the main repository.  Team repositories enable groups of people to have control over certain projects - while public repositories are available online, even to search engines, and private repositories are only visible to the owners.
