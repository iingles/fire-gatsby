Research can be tricky; it's not hard to fall down an obscure rabbit hole on the internet and waste hours chasing the solution to the wrong problem.  A big part of how I do my research 
includes making sure that I'm asking the right questions.  If I'm getting frustrated, I generally take a step back and look at the problem that I'm trying to solve.  If it's something more complex, then I break it down into steps.   

I've found that a lot of the time someone somewhere has come across the same types of problems that I've encountered, and it's not hard to figure out the right combination of subjects to type into Google or the right way to search Youtube videos.  And I don't always read or watch every word or second of the content that I come across.  I skim subjects, making sure that I've got the right idea, and I experiment with what I've found.  If I'm truly, genuinely stuck, I resort to reading the documentation.  (Just kidding).

Tutorial Hell is being stuck in a pattern of consuming tutorials - whether you finish those tutorials or not - and not actually doing anything concrete of your own with the concepts that the tutorials are trying to teach.  It can stem from a feeling that you don't know enough and "should" know more (impostor syndrome), or maybe a fear of failure if you stray from a tutorial and venture out on your own.  What I try to do is think about the types of problems in the world I can solve with the concepts I've learned, and challenge myself by building something on my own.  

The best way I learn is (**dun dun dun**) practice.  You have to do something over and over again if you want it to stick.  That's the reality of learning.  As far as individual learning "strengths", I'd say I'm a visual learner - I learn a lot by just watching how someone else does something.

If I ran into someone new to web development, I'd tell them to run, run as fast as they can in the other direction while there's still time...

But seriously - the web is everywhere in our lives in the modern age and I think that anyone who uses the Internet should at least learn the basics about how it works.  I'd probably tell a person interested in webdev to start at the beginning - learn the basic building blocks of HTML, CSS, and Javascript because ultimately that's how everything is rendered in the browser.  All of these fancy front-end frameworks are built on top of those three technologies, and I'm certain that React, Vue, and Angular will be old news in 10 years but HTML, CSS, and JS will still be around, even if in a more advanced form.
