## What is NPM?  What benefits does it provide?

NPM originally stood for "Node Package Manager"; however in more recent years they have been trying to move away from that and 
just use "NPM" as their name.  It is a command line tool as well as a web registry for packages.  NPM manages bundled packages of code for a variety of languages and applications, and is largely a community supported platform, meaning it is the community who provides most of the code packages.  It is beneficial for a developer because they don't need to re-invent the wheel each time they need a piece of code to perform a particular task, they can just go to a place like NPM and find already used code (and in many cases time-tested and regularly maintained code) to use in their project.  

## What is an NPM module?

An NPM module is a piece of code that is self-contained that you can theoretically "drop in" to your existing codebase.  This does not mean that using an NPM module will not result in conflicts, or tha the modules code might be deprecated.  It is better to use modules
that have a bigger user base and fewer dependencies.

## What are the 3 components of NPM?  Why are they important?

The three components of NPM are the command line tool, the online registry, and the website.  The command line tool is what provides most of the interactivity with NPM; it is where you tell NPM what you want it to do.  The online registry is a public library of NPM modules published by others, it can be browsed via a search tool and is indexed by search engines.  The website can be used to search packages, create a profile, and manage your NPM account.
